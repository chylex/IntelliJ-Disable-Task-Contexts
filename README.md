# Disable Task Contexts <img align="right" src="logo.png" alt="Plugin Logo">

Disables saving and loading context in tasks, and restoring workspace when switching VCS branches.

This plugin works by unregistering everything that saves workspace context. It does not change any settings related to context tracking or workspace restoration.
